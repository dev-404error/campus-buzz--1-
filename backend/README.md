## üöÄ Quick Start Guide for Beginners

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to install these on your computer:

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose the LTS version
   - Install with default settings

2. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - During installation, remember the password you set for the 'postgres' user
   - Default port is 5432 (keep it as is)

### Step 2: Setup the Backend

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Navigate to the backend folder**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup environment variables**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
   - Open the `.env` file in any text editor
   - Update the values:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=campus_buzz
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password_here
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-very-long
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```
   This will create all necessary tables and insert sample data.

6. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend

1. **Create API configuration file**
   Create a new file in your frontend project: `lib/api.ts`

2. **Update your frontend authentication**
   The frontend will automatically connect to `http://localhost:5000/api`

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. **Start both servers:**
   - Backend: `npm run dev` (in backend folder)
   - Frontend: `npm run dev` (in main project folder)

2. **Test login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
   - Use these test credentials:
     - Admin: `admin@college.edu` / `password`
     - Student: `john.doe@college.edu` / `password`
